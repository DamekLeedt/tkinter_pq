# tkinter_pq
My attempt to recreate something akin to Progress Quest, using TKinter as a window, in Python.

TODO: 
    A opening splash screen, with space for a logo, and a New Game, Load Save, and Exit button.
    A "create your character" menu, with a drop-down of classes and races. Both will influence the way you gain stats when leveling up. You can also make a name, or randomize one.
    A "main game" window, that can be resized. It will have six partitions:
        Character Sheet
        Spell Book
        Equipment
        Inventory
        Plot Development
        Quests
    
    I need several lists of things.
        A list of equipment.
        A list of items that can be dropped.
        A list of modifiers.
        A list of spells.
